# MTurnock MSc Thesis - EDTs For Deep Space Missions, A Feasibility Study

This repository contains the software developed for the above mentioned MSc thesis project. Both scripts used in the literature study and main application are included.

NOTE: The software written in C++ is dependent on the Tudat software environment, and so this repository should be included in the appropriate applications folder, and the relevant Cmake files altered in order to run those programs.
