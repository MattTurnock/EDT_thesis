# MTurnock MSc Thesis - EDTs For Deep Space Missions, A Feasibility Study
Link: https://github.com/MattTurnock/EDT_thesis

This repository contains the software developed for the above mentioned MSc thesis project. Both scripts used in the literature study and main application are included.

NOTE: The software written in C++ is dependent on the Tudat software environment, and so this repository should be included in the appropriate applications folder, and the relevant Cmake files altered in order to run those programs.

NOTE2: Most Python files are dependent on running the C++ programs (in the correct order) in order to generate output data, which is not directly included due to the size of files. Setting up the repository in order to properly run these simulations on your machine, and then subsequently running those simulations takes a considerable amount of time, and is therefore not recommended unless truly necessary.
