SUBJECT:  Submission of Voyager 1 magnetic field 48 sec average data to the SPDF CDAWeb for the interval DOY 1 - 365, 2018.

I am submitting 48-sec averages of Voyager 1 magnetic field data for the interval 1 - 365, 2018. These are given in the attached file V1-48s-1-366-2018 sans masked.dat
The columns are:
1. SC   ID (Voyager 1)
2, year
3. DOY (Jan 1 = 1)
4. F1 (the magnetic field strength, the average of higher resolution field strengths, in nT)
5, 6, 7 BR, BT, BN (the magnetic field components in RTN coordinates, in nT)

The one sigma uncertainty is dBN ≈ 0.02 nT and dBT ≈ 0.02 nT. The uncertainty in dBR is larger, since we could not obtain this from a magrol. It could be between 0.02 nT and 0.1 nT; the nominal value is 0.06 nT. 
Let me know when the data are posted.
