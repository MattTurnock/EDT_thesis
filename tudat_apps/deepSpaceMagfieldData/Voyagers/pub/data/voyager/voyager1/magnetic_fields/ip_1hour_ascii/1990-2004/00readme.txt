This directory contains the data set for hourly averages from Voyager 1 
for the interplanetary magnetic field during 1990 to 1999.

The data set format and description are in vy1mag_pri_1hr_format.txt.

Note that 'elevation angle' and 'azimith angle' in this data set are
respectively equivalent to latitude and longitude angle, the latter
being defined from the R or X-HG axis from the Sun to the spacecraft
in Heliographic (HG) coordinates, also called RTN. The T and N 
components of the latter are respectively in the Y-HG and Z-HG 
directions, for which the R-T plane is parallel to the solar
equatorial plane and N is normal to that plane in the +Z-HG direction.
