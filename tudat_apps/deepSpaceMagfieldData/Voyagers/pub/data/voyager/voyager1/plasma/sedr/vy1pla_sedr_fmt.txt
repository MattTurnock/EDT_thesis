The files give the coordinates of the Voyager Space Craft in a column 
format:

year day hour min sec mil-sec  x y z  xx yy zz  r lat long time

x, y, z are Sun-centered ecliptic coordinates, AU  (B1950.0)
xx, yy, zz are Solar Equatorial Coordinate,  AU    (Heliographic system)
r, lat, log are the Solar Equatorial Coordinate in AU and degrees
time is time in years since 1900

The filename format is as follows:

sc_type_start_end_dis.suff

where any of these may be missing.
sc        is Space Craft v1 or v2
type      is type of data, usually the same as the directory name, 
          (e.g. sedr ha )
start     start time year.day.hour ( day and hour may be missing)
end       end   time year.day.hour ( day and hour may be missing)
dis       descriptor, if any addition processing is needed, (e.g. 
          filt implies the data has been filtered, see README in that 
          directory.)
suff      suffix, Z, gz implies the type of compression etc.

The formats may describe more fields that the data sets contain.
In that case, the fields in the description should just be ignored.
In some cases, 00000 is used as a fill, and implies the that data
is unavailable.  Common sense is required to distinguish missing data
from true zeros.
