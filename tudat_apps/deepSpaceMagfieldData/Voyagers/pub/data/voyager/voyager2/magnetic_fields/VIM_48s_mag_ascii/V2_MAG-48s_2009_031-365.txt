SUBJECT:  Submission of Voyager 2 magnetic field 48 sec average data to the VHO for the interval DOY 31-365, 2009 

I am submitting 48-sec averages of Voyager 2 magnetic field data for the interval 31-365, 2009 3. These are given in the 10 attached tab-delimited ascii (.txt) files. 
There are 10 data sets. each with 30 days of data, beginning with DOY 31, 61,  91, 121, 151, 181, 241, 271, 301 and 331, respectively.

The columns are:
1. SC   ID (Voyager 1)
2 year
3. DOY (Jan 1 = 1)
4. F1 (the magnetic field strength, the average of higher resolution field strengths, in nT)
5, 6, 7 BR, BT, BN (the magnetic field components in RTN coordinates, in nT)

The one sigma uncertainty is dBR ≈ 0.03 nT and dBT ≈ 0.03 nT. The uncertainty in dBN is larger, since we could not obtain this from a magrol; it could be between 0.02 nT and 0.1 nT.
