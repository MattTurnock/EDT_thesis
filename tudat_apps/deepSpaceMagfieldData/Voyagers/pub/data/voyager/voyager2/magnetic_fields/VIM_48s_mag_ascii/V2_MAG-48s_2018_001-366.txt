SUBJECT:  Submission of revised Voyager 2 magnetic field 48 sec average data to CDAWeb for the interval DOY 1 - 365, 2018.

I am submitting 48-sec averages of the Voyager 2 magnetic field data for the interval 1 - 365, 2018. 
The 48 sec averages are given in the 12 attached tab-delimited ascii (.txt) files, which are contained in the zip file
There are 12 data sets, beginning with DOY 1, 31, 61, 91, 121, 151, 181, 211, 241, 271, 301 and 331, respectively.

The columns are:
1. SC ID (Voyager 2)
2. year
3. DOY (Jan 1 = 1)
4. F1 (the magnetic field strength, the average of higher resolution field strengths, in nT)
5, 6, 7 BR, BT, BN (the magnetic field components in RTN coordinates, in nT)

The one sigma uncertainty is dBN ≈ 0.03 nT and dBT ≈ 0.03 nT. The uncertainty in dBR could be between 0.02 nT and 0.1 nT.
