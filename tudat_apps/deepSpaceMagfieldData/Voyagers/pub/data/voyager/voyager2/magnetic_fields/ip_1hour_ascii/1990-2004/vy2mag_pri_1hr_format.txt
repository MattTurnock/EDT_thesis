Data File Format: 

There are six tab-delimited columns of archival data in each ASCII text 
file as follows:

   Col 1  The spacecraft number (1 for Voyager 1, 2 for Voyager 2)
   Col 2  The time in decimal year. (90.00000 is day 1 of 1990)
   Col 3  The magnetic field strength,  F1, computed from high-resolution      
          observations.
   Col 4  The elevation angle (degrees) in heliographic coordinates.
   Col 5  The azimuthal angle (degrees) in heliographic coordinates. 
   Col 6  The magnetic field strength, F2, computed from hour averages 
          of the components. The components of B can be computed from F2 
          and the two angles.

The following PRELIMINARY descriptive header text from the data provider 
to all users precedes data in each file: 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
At the time of experiment proposal, it was expected that the required 
accuracy of the measurements would be 0.1 nT, determined by the combined 
noise of the sensors and the spacecraft field. The spacecraft magnetic 
field at the outboard magnetic field sensor, referred to as the primary 
unit, was expected to be 0.2 nT and highly variable, consistent with 
current estimates. Hence, the dual magnetometer design (Ness et al., 
1971, 1973; Behannon et al. 1977). 

At distances > 40 AU, the heliospheric magnetic fields are generally 
much weaker than 0.4 nT; the average magnetic field strength near 40 AU 
and 85 AU is about 0.15 nT and 0.05 nT, respectively. The use of roll 
calibrations lasting  about 6 hours permits determination of the effective 
zero levels for the two independent magnetic axes that are perpendicular 
to the roll axis (which is nearly parallel to the radius vector to the 
Sun) at intervals of about 3 months. There is no roll calibration for the 
third magnetic axis. Comparison of the two derived magnetic vectors 
from the two magnetometers permits validation of the primary magnetometer 
data with an accuracy of 0.02 to 0.05 nT. A discussion of the 
uncertainties that must be considered when using these data is given in 
the Appendix of Burlaga et al. [1994] and in Appendix A of Burlaga et 
al. [2002].
